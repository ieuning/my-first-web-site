        Since December 14th 2020, MDN has been running on the new GitHub-based Yari platform.
         This has a lot of advantages for MDN, but we've needed to make radical changes to the way in which we handle localization.
         This is because we've ended up with a lot of unmaintained and out-of-date content in our non-en-US locales, and we want to manage it better in the future.
